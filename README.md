# AlmostDoctorsAI  
**Applied Physics Group – University of Bari**

Official repository of the **AlmostDoctorsAI** group, dedicated to the development and collection of **Applied Artificial Intelligence** projects, with a particular focus on **scientific and biomedical applications**.

All group projects will be organized and maintained within this repository.  
Repository management (structure, merging, and versioning) will be centralized, but this repository contains **all shared materials**, including:

- Source code  
- Analysis scripts  
- Experiments and prototypes  
- Project documentation  

Further details and project-specific instructions will be progressively added within the corresponding project folders.
