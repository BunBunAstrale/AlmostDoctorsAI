### Project Brain

This directory contains all the analyses related to **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** applied to **Post-Traumatic Epilepsy (PTE)**.

The workflow focuses on:
- Brain connectivity modeling using graph-based representations
- GNN architectures for classification and prediction tasks
- **Explainability methods** to interpret model decisions and identify relevant brain regions and connections

The goal of this project is to combine **neuroimaging-derived brain graphs** with **interpretable deep learning models**, providing both accurate predictions and clinically meaningful insights.
